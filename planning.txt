Tic Tac Toe planning

1. Draw the lines
  1. console log the board
  2. use an array with nine elements to represent the board
    1. Can be 1 dimensional or 2 dimensional
  3. our array will have nine null values to start (if 1 dimensional)
2. Choose X's or O's
  1. Player 1 will be X and Player 2 will be O
3. X's go first
  1. use a "turn" variable to store whose turn it is ("X" or "O")
4. X chooses a spot
  1. replace null value with the turn variable
5. Change the turn
  1. update turn variable to be opposite of what it currently is
6. O chooses a spot
  1. Make sure spot is available
    - If the spot has a null value, it is available
  2. replace null value with the turn variable
7. Repeat until the game ends
  1. while loop
8. Check if someone gets three in a row, they are the winner
  1. This should take place at the end of each turn
  2. we will index numbers of hte positions we are checking (1 dimensional) or row or col numbers (2 dimensional)
  3. if statement used to introduce brnaching
9. It's a tie if there are no more playable spots and no winner
  1. This should take place at the end of each turn
  2. No more mull values and none of the checks from Step 8 were true
10. Repeat the whole process to play again
